# Active Editor Info Demo

This package opens a dockable item showing various info about the active text editor. The development of this package follows the steps in [Package: Active Editor Info](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/package-active-editor-info/) section within chapter 3 of the Atom Flight Manual.

To test this package in your local Atom install, save the contents in a directory inside your .atom/packages, which is located either off of user home or as a sibling to the application if you're running Atom in portable mode.
